# RMS-Restaurant-Management-System
Its my First Semester Project. It is a restaurant Management system. I have designed this system to manage a restaurant counter. It has all the food items. Obviously, you can alter the items Accordingly. The Prices of food items can be changed in code. Also, this system facilitates the manager to subtotal the bill and make a receipt of it with a unique Bill ID (Reference). Receipt can be locally stored on your devices as well as it will be pushed on to the database Such as Microsoft Access.
